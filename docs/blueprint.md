## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), representing intelligence and strategic thinking.
- Background color: Dark gray (#303030), creating a sophisticated, tech-forward feel. This will allow graphical elements to pop.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#3F51B5), to highlight key insights and calls to action. Its brightness contrasts against the background and distinguishes from the purple.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short body text, with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer blocks of text. 'Space Grotesk' will give the app a tech-forward look, and 'Inter' will maintain readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing different modules and functions.
- Information should be visually layered for users of differing seniority, with C-suite execs able to quickly obtain the big picture, and project managers able to drill down to a task view.
- Subtle animations and transitions to indicate data updates and strategic realignments.
